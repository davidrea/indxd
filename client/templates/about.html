<h1>What's this about?</h1>

<p>A few months before our son was born in 2013, I went searching for a notebook to fill with milestones and thoughts about parenthood. I was looking for an American-made alternative to the ubiquitous Moleskine, and my search quickly led me to <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>. It wasn't long before I was hooked on pocket notebooks - I started using them daily: tracking tasks, logging events, jotting down thoughts and planning business ideas. I adopted Ryder Carroll's <a href="http://www.bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal System</a> to keep track of all the stuff I was capturing.</p>

<p>Once I reached 10 books in just under 2 years, I realized that I was assembling a library of information with no way to find any of it. Most of my books had an index, but...where did I jot that note about the "done" temperature of a baked potato? Hard to say without flipping through each book. I've heard of others scanning their notebooks, but this still lacks [reliable] search-ability, and it's enough work to turn the excitement of starting a new notebook into dread of scanning 48 little pages.</p>

<p>I decided I need a simple, search-able, sortable, easy-to-capture index for the topics in my books, and Notebook Index was born. I built this site to provide a no-frills topic index for those stacks of pocket notebooks we both know we're accumulating.</p>

<h1>Is my information safe?</h1>

<p>Your notebook list and topic index are unique and private to your account; no other users can see the content you add to Notebook List. The content of your lists is not encrypted on the server, so you might want to use a code-word for deeply personal topics.</p>

<p>Notebook Index e-mails you a backup of your book list and topic index as a plain text file once a week. I recommend filing these away in your e-mail system - they'll be search-able in a pinch, and if this site ever goes away, you'll still have your data.</p>

<h1>How is it built?</h1>

<p>Around the same time I realized I needed a Notebook Index, I was also looking for a good excuse to try out the <a href="http://meteor.com/">Meteor JavaScript Framework</a>. I built this site using Meteor, with some help from plug-ins for Underscore.js, jQuery, FontAwesome and Bootstrap.</p>

<p>For now, this site is served up from Meteor's cloud hosting service. If it eventually outgrows that service, I'll migrate it to a Node.js + MongoDB provider that's up to the task. Since that will probably cost money, I'll probably ask for donations, but my goal is to keep this site free to use and enjoy.</p>

<p>Notebook Index is Open Source Software. The full source code of the app is published on GitHub.</p>
